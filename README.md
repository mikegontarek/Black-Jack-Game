# Black-Jack-Game
Black Jack Game

- This is a game that I made with Java.  It uses a scanner and some functions to draw random cards, print the card, and one to ask the user to hit or stay. 

- Print card uses a switch case to display the string that is the card.  This has 13 cases as there are 13 cards used in blackjack. 
- Draw a random card that converts a random number which is a double into an int to use in the print card class.
- Hit or stay is a function that I call to keep the code in main less congested.
